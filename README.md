Crypto DAU Top 10 Simplistic Web App
Project Overview
This project aims to create a simple web application that displays the Daily Active User (DAU) counts for the top 10 cryptocurrencies. The DAU data is fetched from the CoinGecko API, and the information is presented in the form of a line graph for easy visualization.

Features
Displays DAU counts for the top 10 cryptocurrencies.
Utilizes the CoinGecko API to fetch historical DAU data.
Presents the data in a line graph using Plotly.
Customizes the web app appearance with CSS for a modern and clean design.
Project Structure
app.py: The main Flask application that serves the web page and handles requests.
templates/index.html: The HTML template for the web page.
static/style.css: The CSS file for customizing the web app's appearance.
your_script.py: The Python script that fetches data and generates the Plotly graph (replace with your actual script).
crypto_dau_plot.html: The HTML file where the Plotly graph is saved (generated by your script).
Usage
Make sure you have Python, Flask, Plotly, and other necessary libraries installed.

Run the Flask application by executing app.py:

Copy code
python app.py
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to view the web app.

Explore the DAU counts for the top 10 cryptocurrencies presented in the line graph.

Customization
You can customize the appearance of the web app by modifying the CSS in static/style.css. Feel free to adjust the colors, fonts, or layout to match your preferred design.

Important Notes
This web app uses the Flask development server, which is not suitable for production. In a production environment, use a production-ready server like Gunicorn.

The project demonstrates a basic setup. For a production-ready deployment, consider security and scalability measures.
